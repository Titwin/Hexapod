# Hexapod
My Hexapod source code repository.

The robot was design in order to participate to the french robotic cup. But the first step before a full autonomus robot is to design one remootely controlled.

## Mecanic
The mecanic of the robot can be found on Onshape, under the project name : "Hexapod Ironcrabs"
Or if your lazy and don't want to search, here is the link : [Hexapod Ironcrabs on Onshape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/e26a3b7c69fc81b4256c14c0/w/d2bfec1e1ae743a3e4b564fc/e/f59567beb0b7a79da3099916)

PS : I'm actually working on a new version of the mecanic so The software is not yet related to the CAO version.

## Electronic
All the electronic board (exept sensor board or Raspberry Pi), was developped on [CircuitMaker](https://workspace.circuitmaker.com/)
There is several boards on this project, so several CircuitMaker project was created (one for each).
